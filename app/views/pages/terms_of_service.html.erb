<h3>NEOFICTION TERMS
OF SERVICE</h3>

<br />

<p><b>FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS REGARDING TERMS OF SERVICE</b></p>

<p>By becoming a member of neoFICTION you agree to the full
Terms of Service, set forth below.&nbsp; The following are frequently asked
questions about the Terms of Service, but the full Terms of Service are what
governs your use contract with neoFICTION.</p>

<p>Q: WHAT IS THE MOST IMPORTANT THING I SHOULD KNOW ABOUT THE
TERMS OF SERVICE?:</p>

<p style='margin-left:.5in;text-indent:-.5in'>1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; You
affirm that the stories, photos, videos and other intellectual property content
that you post to neoFICTION is 100% owned by you, and that you may legally post
it without restriction.</p>

<p style='margin-left:.5in;text-indent:-.5in'>2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; You
grant neoFICTION the non-exclusive right to use and monetize your content,
sharing what we on monetized works with contributors 50-50 (after deduction of
costs).</p>

<p style='margin-left:.5in;text-indent:-.5in'>3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; You
acknowledge and agree that your content may be combined with the content of
other users to create stories and other artistic works using neoFICTION'
content branching system.</p>

<p>Q: WHAT KINDS OF CONTENT AM I ALLOWED TO CONTRIBUTE TO NEOFICTION?</p>

<p>A: &nbsp;&nbsp;Initially neoFICTION is focused on
stories.&nbsp; But in the future you will be able to post or upload all types
of content - video, audio, text, pictures - provided they belong to you, are
100% original and they do not contain anyone else's work that you don't have
the right to distribute.</p>

<p>Q: &nbsp;WHAT DOES IT MEAN THAT NEOFICTION HAS THE Ã”NON-EXCLUSIVE
RIGHT' TO MONETIZE MY CONTENT?</p>

<p>A: &nbsp;By posting or uploading content to neoFICTION , you
give neoFICTION the non-exclusive right to make money with it. &nbsp;Non-exclusive
means you still own your content and you can still sell it outside of neoFICTION
however you want. &nbsp;But, if neoFICTION can figure out how to turn a profit
with it, we're allowed to do that, as long as we share those profits with you. </p>

<p>THEREFORE: &nbsp;If you are planning on selling your content
to a publisher or third-party distributor who may want to purchase the
EXCLUSIVE rights to your content, do not post it on neoFICTION.</p>

<p>Q:&nbsp; HOW LONG DOES MY NON-EXCLUSIVE LICENSE TO NEOFICTION
LAST?</p>

<p>&nbsp;There is no termination clause. Your non-exclusive
license to us lasts as long as your copyright in your content.&nbsp; This
license does not end when you edit or delete your content.&nbsp; neoFICTION
keeps historical snapshots of the content on the site.&nbsp; We reserve the
right to use any version of your content that you have posted to our
website.&nbsp; </p>

<p>Q: WHAT DO YOU MEAN BY "MONETIZED WORKS?"</p>

<p>A: &nbsp;We do not know whether any of the jointly produced
content on neoFICTION will become valuable.&nbsp; Perhaps one storyline will
gain a following and we are able to license it for sale as a book, an article,
a story in a compilation, etc.&nbsp; We don't know whether that will happen and
we certainly cannot guaranty it, but we are have organized this site to make it
a possibility.</p>

<p>When content becomes a "Monetized Work" it means that neoFICTION
is planning to publish, sell or distribute it outside the NEOFICTION website for
money. &nbsp;Perhaps it will become a book, or part of a short story anthology.
&nbsp;After costs, NEOFICTION splits the money it makes 50-50 with those Authors
whose work is included in the Monetized Work. </p>

<p>EXAMPLE: &nbsp;Say a particular storyline on neoFICTION
becomes popular and somehow neoFICTION manages to turn it into a money-making work.
&nbsp;Fifty percent of that money would go to the parent company of neoFICTION.
The other fifty percent goes to all the contributors whose content are resourced
in the production.&nbsp; All of the writers, editors, photo or video
contributors &#8211; everybody who had a hand in creating the final product
gets their fair share based on how much they contributed.</p>

<p>Q: HOW IS THE CONTRIBUTOR'S POOL SPLIT UP?</p>

<p>A: For stories and other purely written works the writers
will be compensated based on the number of chapters that they wrote.&nbsp;
Where other media, such as photos or images, is mixed with the story, the management
will propose something that they think is fair.&nbsp; All contributors will
have an opportunity to offer feedback and then neoFICTION' management will make
the final call.</p>

<p>Q: WILL I BE ABLE TO EDIT MY CONTENT AFTER I SUBMIT IT?</p>

<p>Yes, you have the option of editing your content after
submitting it.&nbsp; However, neoFICTION may use earlier versions of your
content.&nbsp; Also, be aware that if you substantially change your content,
you may alienate writers that have contributed content down-stream from you.</p>

<p>Q: WHY DO WE REQUIRE A LICENSE TO USE YOUR CONTENT?</p>

<p>One of the founding ideas of&nbsp; neoFICTION is that people
can collaborate to jointly produce stories and other content that are better
than the sum of their parts.&nbsp; These stories may even have value
someday.&nbsp; But it would be impossible to sell or license these works of
many authors if every author could withhold the rights to his or her part of
the story, however small.&nbsp; That's why we need your agreement to let us use
your content once you post it on our site.</p>
